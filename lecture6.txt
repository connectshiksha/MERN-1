You are tasked with creating a function that fetches data from a remote API endpoint and displays it after a specified delay. The function should utilize promises, setTimeout, and the fetch API to achieve the desired behavior.

Requirements:

1. Create a function called fetchWithDelay(url, delay) that takes two arguments:
url: The URL of the remote API endpoint from which to fetch data.
delay: The delay (in milliseconds) before displaying the fetched data.

2. Inside the fetchWithDelay function:
Use the fetch API to make a GET request to the specified URL.
Use a Promise to handle the asynchronous nature of the fetch operation.
Utilize setTimeout to introduce the specified delay before displaying the fetched data.
Once the delay expires, resolve the Promise and display the fetched data.

3. Handle any errors that may occur during the fetch operation and display appropriate error messages.
