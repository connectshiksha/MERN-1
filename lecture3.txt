// problem Statement 2  

// You are developing a language processing application, and one of the tasks involves counting the number of vowels in a given sentence. Your goal is to create a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

// Requirements:

// Create a function named countVowels that takes a sentence as a parameter.
// Inside the function, initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of vowels.
// Iterate through each character in the sentence and check if it is a vowel (case-insensitive).
// Increment the counter for each vowel found.
// Display the count of vowels in the sentence.

//  Example 
// countVowels('JavaScript is fun!');
// // Outputs: The sentence has 5 vowels.
